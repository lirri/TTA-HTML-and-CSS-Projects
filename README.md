<h1>HTML and CSS Projects</h1> 

This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS.

<h4>Space Station Site</h4>
This page is an example home page for a space travel company. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers and a form. 

<h4>Movie Theater Site</h4>
This page is an example of a movie theater site that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
