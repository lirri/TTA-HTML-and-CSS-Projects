        <h2>Using the Article Element</h2>
        <p>This is an article element, which specifies independent, self-contained content. <br /> </p>
    </article>
    <details>
        <summary>Using the Summary and Details Tags</summary>
        <p>
            The details tag specifies additional details that the user can open and close on demand. It's often used to create an interactive widget that the user can open and close. By default, the widget is closed. When open, it expands and displays the content within. Any sort of content can be put inside the details tag. <br />
            The summary tag is used in conjunction with the details tag to specify a visible heading for the details. 
        </p>

        <h2>Using the time tag and datetime attribute</h2>
        <p>
            The time tag defines a specific time (or datetime).<br />
            The datetime attribute of this element is used to translate the time into a machine-readable format so that browsers can offer to add date reminders through the user's calendar, and search engines can produce smarter search results. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Note: The time element doesn't render as anything special in any of the major browsers.</em>
        </p>
        <p>My usual sleeping hours are from <time>02:00</time> to <time>09:30</time> all days of the week.</p>
        <p>Though I have an appointment on <time datetime="2021-07-06 08:00">Tuesday</time></p>
